# How computer transistors works?

In a computer, transistors are like millions of these tiny switches packed together. They are made of special materials that can control the flow of electricity. By turning these switches on and off, we can represent & manipulate information.
Think of the switches as traffic lights. When the traffic light is green, cars can go through, & when it's red, the cars have to stop. Similarly, when a transistor is on, we can say it represents a "1," & when it's off, it represents a "0."
These 1s & 0s form the building blocks of computer information. By combining many transistors together in clever ways, we can create circuits that perform calculations, store data, & make decisions.
Just like a light switch in your room controls the flow of electricity to a light bulb, transistors in a computer control the flow of electricity through circuits. They allow computers to perform tasks, solve problems, & help us in countless ways!
So, a computer transistors are like tiny switches that can turn on & off to control the flow of electricity, & by doing so, they enable computers to process information & carry out tasks.

# What is Html?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard language used to create web pages. It is the foundation of any website on the internet. HTML is a markup language, which means it uses tags to define different elements on a web page. 

To explain it more, think of a webpage as a house. HTML is the blueprint that tells the browser how to build & display that house. Just like a blueprint has different sections for walls, doors, & windows, HTML has different tags for headings, paragraphs, images, & links. When you visit a website, your browser reads the HTML code & uses it to render the page. This is why you can view the same website on different devices & browsers, because they all underst& also used to create the structure & content of web pages. It's the backbone of the internet & the first step in building any website.
